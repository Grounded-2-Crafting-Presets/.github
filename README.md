## Article Description

## Product Description

Think of this guide as a **Crafting Preset Pack** built from in-game features plus clean habits. You’ll set up **favorite recipes**, **hotbar logic**, **stash sorting rules**, and **portable build kits** so you stop fumbling mid-fight or mid-farm. The goal isn’t just speed—it’s **consistency**. Every run uses the same slots, the same recipe pins, and the same stash layout. Your hands operate on autopilot while your brain focuses on pathing and positioning.

You’ll create three anchor presets—**Adventure**, **Build**, and **Boss Prep**—then sprinkle in optional mini-presets for biomes (swamp, hedge, sandbox vibes) so you’re never missing that one tool or ingredient again.

## Features 🚀

* **Favorite Recipes, Actually Favorite:** Pin your core loop (heals, torches, arrows/bolts, repair glue, basic meals/potions) so they’re always at the top of the wheel.
* **Hotbar Lanes That Never Change:** Tools on the left, combat in the middle, utilities on the right. Your thumbs never ask “where’s my torch?”
* **Smart Stash Rules:** One chest = one purpose. Label by function (heals, ammo, tools, building mats) instead of by “whatever fit.”
* **Portable Build Kits:** Pre-pack mats for lean-to, light sources, workbench, markers, and ziplines/ropes. Drop a micro-base anywhere in minutes.
* **Biome Mini-Presets:** Swap a couple items per region (ant acid, splash protection, heat/cold items) without touching the core layout.
* **Repair Flow:** Keep glue and common weapon mats pinned so repairs happen before they’re urgent.
* **Craft Queue Discipline:** Batch craft in threes and fives; leave space for loot so your bag never hard-caps mid-run.
* **Visual Coding:** Color or icon consistency for chests and markers so you spot the right stash at a glance.
* **Controller & KB/M Friendly:** Binds and wheel categories work clean on both—no claw gymnastics.
* **Low Cognitive Load:** Fewer icons, cleaner categories, faster decisions. More brainpower left for combat reads.

## Comparisons with Other Options 🎯

**Random Crafting vs. Preset Crafting**

* *Random:* Every session is a scavenger hunt; you forget key mats, blow time in menus, and panic craft during fights.
* *Preset:* Same buttons, same slots, same stash each run. Your hands do it before you think about it—pure flow.

**Base-Locked Crafting vs. Field Kits**

* *Base-Locked:* You run home for every little thing.
* *Field Kits:* Carry a tiny bench/lean-to/torch bundle; you set up, craft, and keep moving. Route efficiency goes brrr.

**Bulk Hoarding vs. Targeted Stockpiles**

* *Hoarding:* Ten chests full of “misc.”
* *Targeted:* Two stacks where they matter. You never over-collect fiber because your preset tells you when you’re good.

## Installation Instructions — Build Your Crafting Preset Pack 🛠️

### 1) Lock Your Hotbar Lanes

Set it once and never move it.

* **1:** Melee (primary)
* **2:** Ranged (primary ammo type)
* **3:** Shield/block or parry tool
* **4:** Heal (bandage/meal/potion)
* **5:** Throwable/utility (bomb, lure, trap)
* **6:** Light (torch, headlamp)
* **7:** Build tool/hammer
* **8–10:** Situational (scanner, gather tool, region item)

> Pro tip (not saying the word 😉): If you switch weapons, swap the **item**, not the **slot**. Muscle memory > chaos.

### 2) Pin Your Core Recipes

Open the crafting menu and favorite:

* **Sustain:** Bandages, simple meals, stamina or resist potions.
* **Travel:** Torches, markers, zip materials, rope.
* **Combat:** Arrows/bolts, repair glue, traps.
  Now your wheel shows your loop at the top, every time.

### 3) Create the Three Main Presets

* **Adventure Preset:** Heals x3 stacks, torch, spare weapon, markers, basic meal. Use for story and exploration.
* **Build Preset:** Hammer, stack of planks/ropes, light sources, lean-to and bench mats. Use for bases and pathing.
* **Boss Prep Preset:** Best weapon kit, resist consumables, extra heals, repair mats, trap bundle. Use for big fights.

Save each as a **profile** if the game supports it; otherwise, keep a quick checklist in your head or notes so you can switch in under 30 seconds.

### 4) Stash Sorting That Actually Works

* **Chest 1 — Heals & Food:** All sustain mats and crafted items.
* **Chest 2 — Weapons & Repairs:** Spare weapons, glue, upgrade bits.
* **Chest 3 — Ammo & Throwables:** Arrows/bolts, bombs, traps.
* **Chest 4 — Build Mats:** Planks, ropes, decorative stuff, lights.
* **Overflow Bin:** Anything you’re not sure about goes here for later sorting.
  Mark each chest with a distinct icon and color so you don’t read labels; you recognize the symbol and move.

### 5) Pack a Field Kit

For every long run, carry mats for:

* **Lean-to** (safety save + fast rest)
* **Workbench or quick-craft station** (if applicable)
* **Two lights** (camp and path beacon)
* **Marker** (breadcrumb for dense areas)
* **Zipline/rope pieces** (optional, route-dependent)

Drop the kit, craft what you need, scoop it back up, keep rolling. Minimal downtime.

### 6) Batch Craft With Breathing Room

Craft in sets (3–5 bandages, 20–40 arrows), then stop. Leave **15–25% bag space** for new mats so you never hard-cap on a farm loop.

### 7) Repair Before It’s Red

Set a mental threshold: if a weapon hits **60–70%**, repair after the next fight. Keep glue/repair mats pinned so it’s three clicks, not a base trip.

### 8) Biome Mini-Presets

Adjust two or three slots per region:

* **Hedge/Wet Areas:** Extra lights, anti-poison or anti-acid, climbing tools.
* **Sandy/Hot Areas:** Heat/refresh items, extra water, shade lamps.
* **Underground:** More torches, markers, shorter routes with close lean-tos.

### 9) HUD & Wheel Clean-Up

Hide fluff icons, make key markers bold, and keep the crafting wheel limited to your favorites. Fewer choices = faster decisions.

### 10) Practice the Crafting Loop

Run this rhythm until it sticks: **Fight → Heal if needed → Quick craft top-up → Repair if threshold → Move.**
Set a timer mindset: if you’re in menus longer than fifteen seconds, you’re off-preset—fix layout, not effort.

## Conclusion

**Grounded 2 crafting presets** aren’t just about speed—they’re about **certainty**. When your hotbar never changes, your recipes are always pinned, your stashes are idiot-proof, and your kit travels with you, the whole game softens. You’ll spend less time staring at menus and more time conquering routes, building pretty bases, and winning fights. Lock in the three main presets, add a couple of biome swaps, and let the loop carry you: craft, move, win, repeat. GG. 🪓✨
